# Arduino Projects

I've been playing around with an Arduino recently, learning how to hack on
hardware and software again. It's fun. :) Here's a repository with random small
projects I've used to learn something new.

I think the biggest (re)learning curve so far has been remembering how to write
C++. And getting frustrated by a lack of blocks. ;-)

## Projects

I've got a couple other projects to import from my old laptop at some point, but this weekend's project has been:

* [die](die) which takes a button and a single LED digit, and allows you to
  roll a random number. My son, Malcolm, suggested it, so we could play Ludo.
